Don’t have anything planned this weekend? Sign up for The Loop and discover popular upcoming events near you! This Rails app with AngularJS front-end uses the Eventful API along with user created events to populate a PostgreSQL database with events ranging from festivals to sporting events and everything in between. With the help of the Google Maps API, the Loop provides a nice visual of surrounding events by populating a roadmap with markers associated to upcoming events. Now you’ll never be out of The Loop!
